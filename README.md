# Fennel Auto Stock Buyer

This is a simple Python script that uses the Fennel Invest API to automatically buy stocks across all accounts associated with a user's login.

## How it works

It's pretty simple:
1. Install dependencies (just fennel-invest-api)
2. Run the script (python app.py)
3. Give your authentication info
4. Specify a stock ticker and quantity
5. Watch it place buy orders for the specified stock on all available accounts

## Maintenance

This script is just a small script I wrote up real quick for personal use, so I'm not going to be adding any new features or fixing any bugs. If you want to contribute, feel free to open a PR though and I'd be happy to review it.

Just putting this out there for anyone who wants it.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project and not an official Fennel Invest product and I am not a financial advisor. Use at your own risk. The script is provided as-is, without any guarantees or warranty. I am not responsible for any financial losses incurred through the use of this script.
